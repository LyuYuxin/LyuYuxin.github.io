We use the structural re-parameterization method to optimize the generation process of the attention map. CBAM has long been among the most widely used attention techniques because of its simplicity and good performance. The success of RepVGG shows great application potential of the structural reparameterization methods, which we notice that could be used to further strenthen the ability of the CBAM. Based on YOLOX, we test our method on a self-built wild animals dataset. The result shows better performance compared to the original CBAM. Notebly, the gain is totally FREE OF CHARGE. Compared to the baseline model, no extra parameters or FLOPs are introduced during the inference stage.
